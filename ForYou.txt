	BDD, ATDD ->Acceptance Test Driven Development, FDD->Feature Driven Development ,TDD )	
		FDD(Feature Driven Development) is a method to develop softwares. FDD recommends feature based development. The sprints, team and deliver is based on features
		ATDD is a collaborative practice where users, testers, and developers define automated acceptance criteria early in the development process. ATDD helps to ensure that all project members understand precisely what needs to be done and implemented
		 In ATDD the acceptance criteria are defined in early in application development process and then those criteria can be used to guide the subsequent development work.
